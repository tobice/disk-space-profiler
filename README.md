# disk-space-profiler

TornadoFX / Kotlin app that finds directories & files that take up the most space.

## How to run this

Currently the only supported way is via Intellij IDEA.

1. Import the code as a new project.
2. Make sure you're using Oracle JDK (Open JDK did not work for me).
3. Import Maven dependencies.
4. Run DiskSpaceProfilerApp. Or the test.
