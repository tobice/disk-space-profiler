# This allows Mockito to mock final classes #sorcery
#
# This is pretty much a hack to bypass Kotlin's behavior that all classes are by default final.
# Which they should be but it makes testing harder. The obvious solution here is to use interfaces,
# which would arguably be lots of pointless grunt work as those interfaces would exist only for the
# sole purpose of testing. So... it's nice to have this hack.
